# AXE: Cloud Hatchet

The goal of the AXE tools is to help discovery and management of your AWS virtual infrastructure without taking the place of the existing suite that you're likely already using; AWS CLI, Terraform, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Salt, etc.

They're aimed at being simple helper commands that are complimentary to the existing toolset.
